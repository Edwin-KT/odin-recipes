      Crispy and flavourful patties, loaded up with all the toppings, slathered
      with homemade burger sauce, what could be a better Friday night dinner?
      You can pick and choose what toppings you like on it so it’s perfect for
      the whole family’s tastes! Plus it takes less than half an hour to make so
      I like to make a couple of sides to go with it and have a proper feast.

    <h3 class="ingredients-title">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredient-list">
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
      <li>4 (6-inch) squares parchment paper</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
      <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps-title">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a
        cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and
        preheat until smoking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until
        lightly browned. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the
        meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each
        ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent
        sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty)
        and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy
        spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press
        down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat
        with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the
        centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula,
        gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them
        with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain
        patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each
        stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.
      </li>
    </ol>
